# Icom-7300-TimeSync 
# Installation and Configuration

The main instructions are for Linux, if you want to use the Program in Windows then look below 
for 'Windows Installation Procedure'


You will need the python3 pyserial library - if that is not installed you need to install it for the user
that you are using the script as ('root' if you are running it from the udev rules) - consult you OS Docs

Suggested Installation Procedure
--------------------------------

cd ~
mkdir -p ~/git
git clone https://github.com/g0lgs/Icom-7300-TimeSync.git ~/git/Icom-7300-TimeSync
cd ~/git/Icom-7300-TimeSync

I place a copy of the Script for each radio in /usr/local/bin

i.e
	cd ~/git/Icom-7300-TimeSync

	sudo cp Set-Icom-DateTime.py /usr/local/bin/Set-Icom7100-DateTime.py
	sudo cp Set-Icom-DateTime.py /usr/local/bin/Set-Icom7300-DateTime.py
	sudo cp Set-Icom-DateTime.py /usr/local/bin/Set-Icom9700-DateTime.py

	sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/Set-Icom7100-DateTime.py
	sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/Set-Icom7300-DateTime.py
	sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/Set-Icom9700-DateTime.py

Then edit the following lines in each script:

	radio="7100"
	radiociv="0x88"
	baud = 115200				# Baud Rate

	serialport = "/dev/ttyUSB0"		# Serial port of your radios serial interface.

	radio="7300"
	radiociv="0x94"
	baud = 115200				# Baud Rate

	serialport = "/dev/ttyUSB0"		# Serial port of your radios serial interface.

	radio="9700"
	radiociv="0xA2"
	baud = 115200				# Baud Rate

	serialport = "/dev/ttyUSB0"		# Serial port of your radios serial interface.

Instead of /dev/ttyUSB0 etc you can set a serial port by id so that it always connect to the correct radio
which is usefeul if you have more than one usb serial port connected (or see below on using udev)

	serialport = "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_IC-7300_12345678-if00-port0"
or
	serialport = "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_IC-9700_12345678_A-if00-port0"

You can now run the script directly like:

	/usr/local/bin/Set-Icom7300-DateTime.py


Using udev to run the script automatically
------------------------------------------

For the serial port you can use a udev rule to create a symlink that always points to the correct radio and
if you wish run the script to set the Date/Time each time the radio is connected.

You will need to find the appropriate information for each of your radios, using a combiantion of the commands:

	lsusb

    udevadm info -p $(udevadm info -q path -n ttyUSB0)

    udevadm info -a -n ttyUSB0

Look for the following:

	ATTRS{idVendor}
	ATTRS{idProduct}
	ATTRS{serial}

create a udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/

	I use '99-hamlib.rules' but you can use something else as long as it is a .rules

	sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-hamlib.rules

Enter the information found above like:

# IC 7300
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyUSB?" SUBSYSTEM=="tty", \
ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", ATTRS{serial}=="IC-7300 12345678", SYMLINK+="ic7300"
RUN{program}+="/usr/local/bin/Set-Icom7300-DateTime.py"

or

# IC 9700
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyUSB?" SUBSYSTEM=="tty", \
ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", ATTRS{serial}=="IC-9700 12345678 A", SYMLINK+="ic9700a" \
RUN{program}+="/usr/local/bin/Set-Icom9700-DateTime.py"


This will run the script when the Radio is connected or the Computer is started with the Radio connected.

Multiple RUN{program}+="" values may be used if you want to run other programs too (with some restrictions)

After editing udev rules use

	sudo udevadm control --reload

You should then disconnect and re-connect the radios USB to check that it works.

The script should run and log any issues to syslog which you can examine with:

	journalctl | grep DateTime.py | tail -n 10

If it sets the time you should see something like:

	Feb 11 07:23:40:24 <computername> Set-Icom7300-Da[12361]: Set-Icom7300-DateTime.py:main:345 INFO DateTime set on 7300

In the event of a problem something like:

	Feb 11 07:25:19 <computername> Set-Icom9700-Da[11387]: Set-Icom9700-DateTime.py:main:262 WARNING No such port: /dev/ic9700a

If the radio is connected but not switched on then (after a short delay) the logs will show:

	Feb 11 08:12:05 <computername> Set-Icom7300-Da[3480]: Set-Icom7300-DateTime.py:main:311 WARNING No/Unexpected response from 7300 on /dev/ic7300
	Feb 11 08:12:05 <computername> systemd-udevd[3391]: ttyUSB0: Process '/usr/local/bin/Set-Icom7300-DateTime.py' failed with exit code 2.

Turn the radio on and then disconnect and re-connect its USB to try again


Windows Installation Procedure
------------------------------

You will need a recent version of Python for Windows

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download the Latest Python Version for Windows

Open the Installer

	On the Initial Screen select Customize Installation

	Ensure that the follow options are enabled:
		
		'pip'
		'for all users'
		'py launcher'

	(Other options may be deselected if desired)

	Click Next

	Select

		'Install Pythox X.XX for all users'
		'Add Python for environment variables'

	Click Install

	Click Yes (when prompted) about making changes.

	when 'Steup was sucessful' appears Click Close

When the Installation is Complete Open a command prompt

	Enter the command:

	pip install pyserial

Now download the 'Set-Icom-DateTime.py' from this Git Repositry and save it to Your desktop

After Downloading open the file in your prefered Text Editor (i.e Notepad++)

Change the Settings around lines 24 to 35 to set the appropriate values for your radio

	The ones you need to set are:
	
	radio, radiociv, baud and serialport

	it is only necessary to change com3 to whatever you comport (not the "/dev/ttyUSB0" version)

	# Set Radio Model (7100/7300/9700)
	radio="9700"
	# Radio address (7100= 0x88, 7300 = 0x94, 9700 = 0xA2).
	radiociv="0xa2"
	# Radio serial speed
	baud = 115200

	# Serial port of your radios serial interface
	# i.e Linux /dev/ttyUSB0 or Windows com1
	if os.name == 'nt':
	    serialport = "com3"
	    import ctypes
	else:
	    serialport = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
	    import logging
	    from logging.handlers import SysLogHandler

	Save the file

	Now just double-click the File on the Desktop to set the time on the Radio

If you have 2 or more radio's just save the file with different names and edit the settings in each one.
